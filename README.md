# CanonicalCopy

Have you ever went to share a URL and found it was hundreds of characters long,
full of tracking and analytics information?

Web sites that use multiple URLs for the same content are "encouraged" by Google
PageRank algorithms to have [a specific "canonical" URL that is the primary URL
for the page](https://www.semrush.com/blog/canonical-url-guide/). Since this
URL can't be personalized to the user, it isn't full of analytics data or
unnecessary session state.

When copying the URL, just click the CanonicalCopy icon instead of selecting
the URL in the address bar. A popup will appear with the canonical URL that you
can copy with the copy button or Ctrl+C. It's that easy!

## Installation

It's currently in the process of being sent to Daddy Google for permission to
be used. Give it a bit.

## Legal mumbo jumbo
