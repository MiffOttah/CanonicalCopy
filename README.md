# CanonicalCopy

Have you ever went to share a URL and found it was hundreds of characters long,
full of tracking and analytics information?

Web sites that use multiple URLs for the same content are "encouraged" by Google
PageRank algorithms to have [a specific "canonical" URL that is the primary URL
for the page](https://www.semrush.com/blog/canonical-url-guide/). Since this
URL can't be personalized to the user, it isn't full of analytics data or
unnecessary session state.

CanonicalCopy is an extension for Google Chrome and compatible browsers that
allows you to copy this URL instead of the URL you're actively on full of
useless session and tracking data.

When copying the URL, just click the CanonicalCopy icon instead of selecting
the URL in the address bar. A popup will appear with the canonical URL that you
can copy with the copy button or Ctrl+C. It's that easy!

## Installation

CanonicalCopy is now available on the Chrome Web Store! Find it here:
